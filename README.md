# SpringBoot_Employee_CRUD_App
## Spring Boot Application
This is a Spring Boot application, using version 2.7.0 of Spring Boot and Java version 1.8.
I created this application during my time at the Carolina Fintech Hub, using a database to store User login information,
as well as employee information.  You can register a new user by using the /registration page or the link through the
login page.  Once the new user is created you can sign in on the /login page.  Upon logging in you are presented with 
an index page that shows all the users in the employee database.  From this table you are able to add a new employee,
update an existing entry's information, or delete them completely from the database.

## Heroku Deployment
I deployed this application on Heroku so that you are able to interact with this full stack application.
You are able to see this application here().
